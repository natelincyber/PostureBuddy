# Posture Buddy

Empowering members of our community to speak up about issues they face every day with the power of machine learning

## About 
We noticed that many members in our community fail to speak up about issues that affect them everyday, either due to fear or a lack of knowledge about proper presentation etiquette. With Posture Buddy, these individuals can focus on creating a perfect proposal without having to worry about the formalities. Our algorithm detects many common forms of bad posture and shows aspiring presenters how to fix them in a easy to understand format.

## Why Us?

    - Our software automatically detects bad 
    posture using a simple GUI to help streamline the process

- Fast
    - All of our analysis is done in real 
      time so you don't have to worry about 
      waiting for hours at a time to get results.

    Posture Buddy creates a custom report tailored 
    specifically to your needs.
